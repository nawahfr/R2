<!-- [ABSTRACT] -->

#### Objects365 Dataset V1

[Objects365 Dataset V1](http://www.objects365.org/overview.html) is a brand new dataset,
designed to spur object detection research with a focus on diverse objects in the Wild.
It has 365 object categories over 600K training images. More than 10 million, high-quality bounding boxes are manually labeled through a three-step, carefully designed annotation pipeline. It is the largest object detection dataset (with full annotation) so far and establishes a more challenging benchmark for the community. Objects365 can serve as a better feature learning dataset for localization-sensitive tasks like object detection
and semantic segmentation.
